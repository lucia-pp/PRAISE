# PRAISE
PRAISE is a monocentric, randomized, two-arm pilot trial that enrols older adults in the pre-Frailty range (FI 0.10–0.40).  Here you can explore the correlational visual netwoks across the different sudy's timepoints.
To ensure both inclusiveness and robustness, the baseline (T0) analyses were performed using two complementary datasets, which differed in the treatment of HRV measures and potential confounding factors, and consequently in the number of included subjects, and then repeated at T1:	

•	PRAISE T0: all available data are reported in this dataset. HRV indices were considered for all subjects independently of medicine intake but excluding ECG signal not analysed for technical reasons (e.g. artifacts, breathing inconsistencies, arrhythmias). The total sample of PRAISE T0 consists in N=60 subjects.

•	PRAISE HRV T0: thirty subjects undergoing beta blockers, SSRI, Ace-inhibitors, or Benzodiazepine intake (medicines influencing HRV), or with irregular breathing/heartbeat were excluded from the statistical analyses in this dataset, yielding a finale clean sample of 30 subjects. Intrinsic Capacity composite scores are excluded from this visualization

•	PRAISE T1: after 12 months of exergame training subjects underwent the same assessment. Aalysis at T1, given the smaller sample size, where conducted on the entire sample (N=36), irrespectively to medications.
